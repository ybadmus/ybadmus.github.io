                            Sometimes I hear people complaining about their clients, saying that they insist on using Rails, that they’ve had too much Kool Aid. If they’re recruiters, they almost feel sick in the stomach about having to find yet another Ruby on Rails ‘primadona’ developer. Then they pull out something similar to this amazingly ignorant comparison between Git and PHP to prove their point. “They don’t even know what they’re asking for,” they say.
                            <br><br>
                            For us as programmers, sometimes it does indeed seem like our clients don’t have a clue. We love to exaggerate cases like this. When you think a bit about it, it does not seem right to think that a person that is giving me money to build things is somehow limited and ‘just doesn’t get it’. In fact, I believe that most clients know their options just fine and yet they still decide to go with Rails.
                            <br><br>
                            Rails beneficial enough to be seriously considered for a plethora of projects and needs.
                            <br><br>
                            Rails is suitable for both state-of-the-art public websites that compete with Single Page JavaScript applications, and complex enterprise core system applications that usually look a bit ‘uglier’ (with a more generic, lower fidelity UI), but compensate this blemish with a ton of complicated business rules and logic. Aside from these Ruby on Rails use cases, its benefit is that it is versatile and able to compete with both the sleek and the powerful.
                            <br><br>
                            For most of common problems, Rails has a component at your disposal almost right out-of-the-box with documentation that is consistently above average (somehow, the Rails core team persuaded contributors that writing documentation is cool (even though we all know it’s not), leading to well written, concise and time-saving docs).
                            <br><br>
                            When you put aside unicorns and Friday hugs, you end up with a mighty framework that you can be used both for your future game changer and your next middle-of-the-road business site. And with your pool of top-of-the-line gems, you have at your finger tips an arsenal that implements some of the brightest ideas in computer programming. With no fuss.
